* **forecasts_mapped_across_areas.R** - a script that takes median predicted tree cover generated from eval_new_area_predictions.R and maps prediction bias for the 35 year out of sample forecast across all 3 landscapes. Generates manuscript figures.
* **plot_covariates.R** - a script to plot environmental covariates for all 3 landscapes for supplemental figure.
* **plot_cover_across_landscapes.R** - a script that plots observed tree cover for all 3 landscapes over time and for 1986 for Figure 2 in main text.
