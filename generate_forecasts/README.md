## Contents:
* **eval_model_insample.R** - a script that takes parameter estimates from mcmc_samplers.R and forecasts changes in tree cover for a 5 year interval in sample. Forecast performance is then evaluated. Generates manuscript figures.
* **forecastFunctions.R** - contains functions for building forecasts.
* **predict_new_areas.R** - a script that takes parameter estimates from mcmc_samplers.R and forecasts changes in tree cover for 35 years for all 3 study landscapes.
* **eval_new_area_predictions.R** - a script that takes forecasts generated in predict_new_areas.R script and evaluates and compares forecast performance. Generates manuscript figures.
